        My dearest Tannuuu,
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        I know I messed up. I hurt you, the one person I cherish most. And for that, I'm truly sorry. This page is a small way to show how much you mean to me.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Please know that you are loved, respected, and deeply missed. Iâ€™ll keep trying until I see your beautiful smile again.
      </p>
      <p>Forever yours, <br />Adarsh ðŸ’›</p>
